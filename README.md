This project simulates a blackjack game, in which the player and dealer each receive a combination of cards.  There are many features integrated in this project, including functions representing a deck of cards with the ability for the user to shuffle and deal cards.  There is also a function that calculates the player’s and dealer’s total scores based on their hands.
