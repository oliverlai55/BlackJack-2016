<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This project simulates a blackjack game, in which the player and dealer each receive a combination of cards.  There are many features integrated in this project, including functions representing a deck of cards with the ability for the user to shuffle and deal cards.  There is also a function that calculates the player’s and dealer’s total scores based on their hands.</p>

<h2>What I'm Proud Of</h2>
<p>I’m proud of this game because this is the first project in which I had to integrate logical thinking with my programming ability utilizing HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.  This project served as a foundation of my skill-set which I was able to apply to future projects throughout my 4 month course at DigitalCrafts.</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>During the process of completing this particular project, I learned to not only familiarize myself with front-end web development utilizing HTML and CSS, but I also learned how to breakdown a problem into logical steps using pseudocode and convert my thoughts into fully functional Javascript and jQuery in order for users to play the game of blackjack on a web page.</p>
